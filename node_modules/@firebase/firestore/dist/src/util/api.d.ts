/**
 * Helper function to prevent instantiation through the constructor.
 *
 * This method creates a new constructor that throws when it's invoked.
 * The prototype of that constructor is then set to the prototype of the hidden
 * "class" to expose all the prototype methods and allow for instanceof
 * checks.
 *
 * To also make all the static methods available, all properties of the
 * original constructor are copied to the new constructor.
