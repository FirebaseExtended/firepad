     * Starts up the FirestoreClient, returning only whether or not enabling
     * persistence succeeded.
     *
     * The intent here is to "do the right thing" as far as users are concerned.
     * Namely, in cases where offline persistence is requested and possible,
     * enable it, but otherwise fall back to persistence disabled. For the most
     * part we expect this to succeed one way or the other so we don't expect our
     * users to actually wait on the firestore.enablePersistence Promise since
     * they generally won't care.
     *
     * Of course some users actually do care about whether or not persistence
     * was successfully enabled, so the Promise returned from this method
     * indicates this outcome.
     *
     * This presents a problem though: even before enablePersistence resolves or
     * rejects, users may have made calls to e.g. firestore.collection() which
     * means that the FirestoreClient in there will be available and will be
     * enqueuing actions on the async queue.
     *
     * Meanwhile any failure of an operation on the async queue causes it to
     * panic and reject any further work, on the premise that unhandled errors
     * are fatal.
     *
     * Consequently the fallback is handled internally here in start, and if the
     * fallback succeeds we signal success to the async queue even though the
     * start() itself signals failure.
